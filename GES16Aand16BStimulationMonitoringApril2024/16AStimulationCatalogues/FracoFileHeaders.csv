Source,,"The source number within this microseimic group															",,
"Trig Date, Trig Time ",,"The local time of the trigger instant. This is trace time zero as displayed in Divine															",,
"Origin Date, Time",,"The  modelled local date and time of the event. This is the moment the event actually occurred															",,
"Profile														",,"Profile  				Trigger profile name. We only used one profile ie one set of trigger parameters															",,
Status,"														",The nature of the event location. 2 is a located microseismic event,,
"Cluster															",,"The cluster number the event belongs to. Clusters are numbered from 1. An event that is not assigned to a cluster has a number of 0. These data are not clustered													",,
,"The following coordinates are given with respect to the local origin, ground level at the 16A wellhead",,,
Y,,The North coordinate in ft,,
X,,The East coordinate in ft,,
"Depth										",,"The true vertical depth beneath the origin. Positive values increase downwards															",,
MomMag,,Time domain magnitude. Here derived from the P or S waves at well 56 or 78B,,
PGV,,The peak ground velocity. Here derived from the P or S wave at well 56 and 78B,,
"Stage														",,"The stimulation stage														",,
"P S/N														",,"The ratio of the peak P wave trace value to the rms noise level prior to the P pick or time zero if there is no P pick															",,
"S S/N														",,"The ratio of the peak S wave trace value to the rms noise level prior to the P pick or time zero if there is no P pick															",,
"Quality						",,"A dimensionless measure of the event quality. It is the ratio of the Bootstrap stack amplitude to the long term stack amplitude. Usually in the range 2 to 10. Higher values indicate a more reliable event location															",,
"Error								",,"The maximum error in the event location that is consistent with the traveltime pick and hodogram angle misfits. Units are feet. Not reported here														",,
"Location													",,"How the event was located. L2 msmx is a visually checked L2 minimisation. Boot msmx is an automatic Bootstrap location. L2 check is a visually checked L2 minimisation location of a check shot. Only L2 reported here														",,
